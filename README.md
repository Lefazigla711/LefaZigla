<h3 align="center">### Hello, I'm Tonkuru Lefa 🚀 Aspiring Developer | 💡 Front-End Design Enthusiast | 🤖 AI & Automation Advocate I'm Tonkuru Lefa, a budding coder who embarked on this exhilarating journey into the world of programming while navigating the intricacies of law studies. In this unique intersection of disciplines, I've discovered the power of logic, creativity, and innovation that coding brings to the table. 🎨 My true passion lies in the world of front-end design, where I weave together colors, shapes, and user experience to craft digital landscapes that are as beautiful as they are functional. From web development to responsive design, I'm on a mission to make every click and scroll a visually delightful and seamless experience. But my interests don't stop there. I'm also a staunch advocate for the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence and Automation. The possibilities of these technologies are awe-inspiring, and I'm dedicated to exploring how they can shape our future. 🌱 Currently, I'm in the "open to learning" phase of my coding journey, eager to embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge and enhance my technical prowess. The beauty of coding, in my view, is that it's a lifelong quest for innovation. So, expect to see my passion translate into exciting projects, experimental ventures, and collaborative initiatives. I'm just getting started on this thrilling road, and I can't wait to see where it leads. 🤝 Let's connect and learn together. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a design aficionado, or someone equally enchanted by the endless possibilities of technology, I'm excited to collaborate, share ideas, and build something remarkable. The future is as limitless as the code we write, and I'm ready to explore it with you.</h3>
